# School-paper
A simple newspaper for my school built in LaTeX using the newspaper package among others.

Now updated to include all the issues in one repo now that I managed to get it all working properly.

The template is a blank slate so that future issues can be created by simply cloning it. 

Most images to run the code are included in their folders and the compiled .pdf is also included in most cases.

To compile this code yourself, you'll need LaTeX, and the following packages:
    
    inputenc

    fontenc

    microtype

    graphicx

    fancyhdr

    float

    lipsum

    newspaper

    newspaper-mod

    multicol

    picinpar

There is definitely some redundancy here and not all of these packages are called in every issue, but they are nice to have.
